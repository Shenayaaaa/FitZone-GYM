        <h2>1. Fitness Guidance for Seniors</h2>
        <h3>1.1 Overview of Senior Fitness Needs</h3>
        <p>As individuals age, maintaining physical fitness becomes increasingly important for enhancing quality of life and independence. Regular exercise can help seniors improve cardiovascular health, maintain muscle mass, enhance flexibility, and boost mental well-being. Engaging in physical activity not only reduces the risk of chronic diseases such as diabetes and heart disease but also helps improve mood and cognitive function. The CDC recommends that older adults engage in at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity each week, along with strength training exercises on two or more days to ensure a balanced fitness regimen.</p>

        <h3>1.2 Recommended Exercises</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Walking:</strong> A low-impact exercise that improves cardiovascular health and can be easily adjusted to suit individual fitness levels.</li>
            <li><strong>Strength Training:</strong> Utilizing resistance bands, light weights, or bodyweight exercises like squats and push-ups can help maintain muscle mass and bone density.</li>
            <li><strong>Balance and Flexibility Exercises:</strong> Activities like chair yoga and Tai Chi improve stability, flexibility, and mental focus.</li>
            <li><strong>Water Aerobics:</strong> Beneficial for seniors with joint issues as the buoyancy of water minimizes stress on the joints.</li>
        </ul>
